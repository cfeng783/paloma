This is the source code of the Eclipse Plug-in for PALOMA. 

All PALOMA features are defined in quanticol.ed.ac.uk.paloma.   Need to export the project(quanticol.ed.ac.uk.paloma) to a runnable Jar before it can be included in a plugin project!




To know what is PALOMA, how to install and use the Plug-in, please go to https://github.com/cfeng783/paloma/wiki.
